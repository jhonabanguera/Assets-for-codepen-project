# Assets-for-codepen-project

This was the last project I made to receive the Responsive Web Design Certification from freecodecamp, you can look the end result <a href="https://codepen.io/banguerajhon/full/dyzWKoz">Here</a>.</br></br>
The page is responsive for most devices. </br></br>
I had some projects I made during the certification and also other ones I did before that you can also find on my github. </br></br>
To get the page done took a lot of effort, if you had some feedback feel free to contact me on the contact section of the page at the end, I would really appreciate it.
